If we need to create a pascals triangle like above, then do the following:
1. Numbers follows, nCr factorial, so create a function to find the result for that.
2. we will be having 3 loops.
3. First loop (outer) determines number of rows in the resultant.
4. Second loop is for loop determines the number of spaces.
   a. if n = 5, for 1st row it have 4 blank spaces.
   b. if n = 4, 2nd row, it should have 3 blank spaces and so on.
5. end="" in print statement is used to print the element in the same line.
6. Third loop is to place the element or results from the nCr function.
